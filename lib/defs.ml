(* [inherits(x, "name")] is lowered (in [ast.ml]) to a type-case testing [x]
   directly against [inherits_test_ty name]: the set of attr-tagged values whose
   class set includes [name] (other class labels left [Unknown], i.e. they may
   or may not be present -- [inherits] only asserts membership, not the exact
   class set; [AllOthers] would be wrong as it asserts every other class is
   present, a near-empty type). mlsem's occurrence typing then refines [x] in
   both branches: the then-branch to [x & <name, ...>], the else-branch to
   [x \ <name, ...>] (which keeps e.g. the [p(chr)] CHARSXP half of [any_sexp],
   soundly: a CHARSXP carries no class so the test is false for it).

   Testing [x] directly (rather than projecting its class component) keeps the
   type-case total over all SEXPs -- a projection would be partial (undefined on
   the classless [p(chr)]), making [inherits] on a possibly-CHARSXP value
   untypeable. *)

(* setAttrib(vec, R_ClassSymbol, val): the result is vec's value re-tagged with
   the class attribute carried by [val]. This is the dual of
   [getAttrib_class_ty]: there we read class names out of [v]'s [classes]
   component, here we write them in from [val]'s type.

   [setAttrib_class_classes] derives the class component from [val]'s type. When
   [val] is a chr vector whose element type is a positive, finite set of string
   singletons (e.g. [mkString "foo"], typed [t(c_string('a)) -> v[1](chr('a))]
   in base.ty, or a variable holding such a value — the type flows through let
   bindings) we set exactly those classes ([tail = NoOther]). Otherwise the
   concrete names are unknown and we fall back to [Classes.any], i.e. arbitrary
   classes. The [allocVector(STRSXP,n)] + [SET_STRING_ELT] build-up idiom also
   lands here: [allocVector] seeds elements to "" and [SET_STRING_ELT] unions in
   each assigned string (see base.ty), so the element type is the set of strings
   written, plus "".

   The empty string is dropped from the recovered names: it is the STRSXP
   allocation default ("") standing in for any slot not provably overwritten, not
   a class the program asked for, and "" is not a meaningful S3/S4 class name.
   (Soundness note: this means a degenerate genuine "" class would be missed, but
   no real code dispatches on it.) If nothing but "" remains, the names are
   treated as unknown ([Classes.any]). *)

(* SEXPTYPE numeric values from R's [Rinternals.h], mapped to the

   its symbolic name (e.g. [Rf_allocVector(13, n)] is rewritten to
   [Rf_allocVector(INTSXP, n)]) so the call matches the [prim] type-tag
   domain of the [allocVector] signature instead of failing as an
   untypeable application. Values outside this table are left alone; the
   call will then fail downstream, which mirrors the runtime check
   [allocVector] does on the type argument. *)
